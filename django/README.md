The mysite example was created with the following commands:

```
django-admin startproject mysite
```

And then to start the dev web server, this command can be used after entering the first mysite directory: 

```
python manage.py runserver
```

Creating an app within the project is handled by doing this:

```
python manage.py startapp polls
```
