Creating the project using the following command. Degit is a scaffolding tool.

```
npx degit sveltejs/template my-svelte-project
```

After that, it's just a matter of:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Later you can fork the template repo for your own use:

```
npx degit your-name/template my-new-project
```

To compile and make production ready:

```
npm run build
```
